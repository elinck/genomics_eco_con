    "text": "Overview\nThe development of affordable high-throughput sequencing technology in the 2000s and 2010s revolutionized the ability of molecular ecologists, wildlife and conservation biologists, and other environmental scientists to assay genome-wide DNA sequence variation from nonmodel organisms. Genomics methods are now commonly used to study everything from the dietary preferences of sturgeon to genes underpinning local adaptation in wolves, but can be difficult to apply or interpret without specialist training. This course provides a hands-on introduction to the use of genomics in ecology, conservation, and related fields. Students will gain hands-on experience with computational biology, analyzing empirical genomic datasets with commonly applied software on a high-performance computing cluster. Reading assignments from the primary literature will demonstrate the use of focal software packages while emphasizing case studies relevant to conservation biology and fish and wildlife management."

I will not spend my time actively policing their use, but if detected, I will consider it academic misconduct."
